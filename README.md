# Console-Finanaces

## Description
This is a console application that allows the user to manage their finances. The user can add, subtract, and view their transactions. The user can also view their total budget for the month.
In this applIcation we consoled log the total


first we calculate the total number of months included in the dataset which is the length of the array.


then we calculate the total amount of profit/losses over the entire period which is the sum of the profit/losses .
total = sum of all profit/losses
-first store all the profit/losses in an empty array
-then loop through the array and push the first profit/loss into the array




then we calculate the average change in profit/losses over the entire period which is the sum of the profit/losses column divided by the length of the array.

-average change = total change / (number of months-1)
-to find the total change we need to find the difference between the current data and the previous data
-change = currentData - previousData
-total change = sum of all changes
-first store all the changes in an empty array
-then loop through the array and push the first change into the array
-find the total change by looping through the array and adding each change to the total change
-then find the average change by dividing the total change by the length of the array





then I calculated the greatest increase in profits over the entire period which is the maximum value of the profit/losses column.
then w=I calculated the greatest decrease in losses over the entire period which is the minimum value of the profit/losses column.
